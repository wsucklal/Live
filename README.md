#CAPSTONE PROJECT: Live - A Centralized Platform for Nightlife Experiences

Abstract: The nightlife industry, despite its growth, is fraught with challenges that lead to missed
opportunities for both partygoers and venues. The current system lacks a universal platform for finding and
posting nightlife events, has ineffective reservation methods, and inconsistent communication channels.
This results in disappointed partygoers and venues which miss out on potential revenue. The Live app
addresses these challenges by offering a centralized platform for all nightlife needs. The platform allows
users to discover clubs and events tailored to their preferences, while businesses gain the opportunity to
advertise their events, manage reservations, and communicate directly with potential customers. Core
features include reservation bookings, user profiles, and venue discovery. The platform, designed for Apple
iOS and Google Android systems, is implemented using React Native and Express for the frontend and
backend respectively. Live aims to revolutionize the nightlife experience by bridging the gap between
consumers and businesses in the industry.
